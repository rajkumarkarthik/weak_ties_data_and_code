# weak_ties_data_and_code

This repository archives code used in the paper `A Causal Test of the Strength of Weak Ties` by K. Rajkumar, G. Saint-Jacques, I. Bojinov, E. Brynjolfsson, and S. Aral (2022). It comprises two directories:

1. `replication_files`: this directory includes aggregated data and code sufficient to replicate all OLS regressions run in the paper. This code can be run in the R programming language.
2. `paper_code_compilation`: this directory compiles code used to generate all figures and tables in the paper and supplementary materials. However, because the code was run on individual-level data, which is not shared, it will not run and is provided for reference only.
