# Paper code compilation

This repository, `paper_code_compilation`, compiles all the code used to generate figures and tables in the project. The filenames indicate what component of the paper the code file generates. Figures refer to figures in the main paper, while tables refer to those in the SI. E.g., `Fig 2.R` provides all code for the generation of Figure 2 of the main paper.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This code requires individual-level data to run, which is not included with this repository for privacy and legal reasons. The code is provided for reference only. To replicate OLS regressions from the paper, we provide data summary statisticsâ€”means and covariances of all variables. These may be found in the `replication_files` repository.
